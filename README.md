Be 100,000% Confident in Participating in Digital Economy with Coinbase

‘Awesome, gorgeous, speedy, secure, a couple can share it and use it together, congratulations to this feature, really helpful. I have been using it with enjoyment and I love the news, info, and guidance offered in the app.’

Coinbase is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange company founded by Brian Armstrong in 2012. Inspired by complexities he faced to buy, sell and store digital currencies. Armstrong envisioned a simplified and secured platform offering accessible service ranging from beginner traders to institutions. Coinbase has received more than $500million in fundings throughout its existence from different investors. Seed fundings from Y Combinator and later participation from Union Square Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and others. It also has been selling shares as a publicly traded company on Nasdaq since 2021.
The digital economy used to be unreachable for the general public. Therefore, Coinbase aims to expose more users to digital currencies by ease of access and enabling control over digital assets. It also made exchanges from fiat (Eg; USD, CAD,..) to cryptocurrencies and vice versa a lot easier. Another concern that the company addresses is cryptocurrency security. It uses two factor authentication, cold storage security measures and adheres to regulatory compliances to ensure safety of user's assets.
Filipe has been using the Coinbase and Coinbase wallet App for more than four years. “Outside the world of crypto, I am always anxious about missing out on trading opportunities when the market closes. I feel safe to dive into cryptocurrency markets with this app which trades 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and achieve my goals.”

Coinbase's competitive advantage is not limited to usability of the app interface. It accepts a wide range of fiat currencies and as well offers a competitive rate for more than 250 cryptocurrencies. To help beginner investors gain understanding, Coinbase offers a Learning Reward program with incentives. The company now has more than 9 million active traders per month. 
Aniko is an amateur Coinbase trader that started exchanging fiat to crypto during the course of Pandemic. Soon after she installed Coinbase App on her iPhone, began reading about market updates and cryptocurrency volatile markets. One of the unexpected benefits of using this platform is to earn money for completing cryptocurrency courses using Coinbase Learning rewards.

The company implements a magnitude of innovative technologies. It adapts to the blockchain domain in the financial industry; using Distributed Ledger Technology to keep a decentralized history of transactions. And, underlying cryptographic security to encrypt and authenticate private keys in keeping user data and digital assets safe.

Several trends have shaped the digital economy over the past 5-10 years. One of the more popular and unique trends are Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) which enable artists and content creators to hold or sell their piece in a transparent platform over digital assets. On the other hand, development of financial bridges between fiat and crypto was made possible by introducing Stablecoins. Cryptocurrencies like USD Coin(USDC) maintained a certain value by an external asset like USD. In fact, anyone with limited financial infrastructure is now able to trade Stablecoins relying on the internet alone.

Alongside Coinbase, Binance and Kraken are two of the other major players in the digital economy landscape that offer trading services to individuals and institutions. Higher number of active or registered users and higher percentage of total trading volume indicates a rather strong position in this domain. Financial success in terms of revenue built is sustained by a significant number of transaction fees or trading commissions earned. Coinbase currently holds $145B quarterly volume trades and $130B assets on its platform. 
Coinbase could consider expanding featured services in a few ways. An area to explore would be Decentralized Finance protocols for lending options. This could be extremely beneficial for individuals looking forward to diving deeper in the world of crypto. Another area in my opinion would be adding NFTs into their platform as many artists and creators would be enthusiastic to hold such assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.
It is worth noting that Coinbase has a valuable impact in the digital economy. Not only allows newer users to educate themselves and start investing but also helps institutions to hold assets in a safe space. Simplicity, user-friendly interface and a wide range of cryptocurrencies puts Coinbase in a strong position in the domain of digital asset industry.
